# Gift Card Configuration Fix

## Problem Identified

The bot was responding with "failed to update giftcard config" when users tried to disable gift card functionality.

## Root Cause Analysis

From the server logs, the error was:

```
Error updating gift card config for store 7409: storeConfigService.updateStoreConfig is not a function
```

The issue was in the `src/services/mcpToolExecutor.js` file where incorrect method names were being used.

## Technical Details

- **Incorrect Method**: `storeConfigService.updateStoreConfig()`
- **Correct Method**: `storeConfigService.updateCurrentConfig()`
- **Affected Functions**: 3 new MCP tools that were recently added

## Files Fixed

**File**: `src/services/mcpToolExecutor.js`

**Changes Made**:

1. Line ~399: `updateWelcomeMessage()` method - Fixed method call
2. Line ~457: `updateGiftCardConfig()` method - Fixed method call
3. Line ~493: `updateLoyaltyPoints()` method - Fixed method call

All three functions were using `updateStoreConfig()` instead of `updateCurrentConfig()`.

## Resolution

✅ **Fixed**: All method calls now use the correct `updateCurrentConfig()` method
✅ **Tested**: Server starts successfully without errors
✅ **Status**: Ready for user testing

## Testing Commands

Users can now test these commands with the bot:

- `"Disable giftcard"` - Should disable gift card functionality
- `"Enable giftcard"` - Should enable gift card functionality
- `"Set gift card min 10 max 100"` - Should set gift card limits
- `"Update welcome message 'Hello customer!'"` - Should update welcome message
- `"Enable loyalty points"` - Should enable loyalty points
- `"Disable loyalty points"` - Should disable loyalty points

## Server Status

- ✅ MongoDB Connection: Working
- ✅ Telegram Webhook: Configured (https://ab0a9a7675b9.ngrok-free.app/webhook/telegram)
- ✅ MCP Tools: 10 tools operational (7 original + 3 new fixed)
- ✅ External Access: Via ngrok tunnel

## Next Steps

1. Test the gift card disable/enable functionality via Telegram bot
2. Verify all new configuration features are working properly
3. Monitor server logs for any additional issues
